## Introduction

Pagination is a technique used to divide large datasets into smaller, more manageable chunks, typically displayed on separate pages. This project focuses on implementing pagination functionality in a web application, allowing users to navigate through the data efficiently.

## Resources

- [REST API Design: Pagination](https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/REST-API-Design-Pagination-Sorting-and-Filtering/)
- [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
- [Server-side Pagination in Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/server-side-pagination-in-python/)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and benefits of pagination in web applications.
- Implement a pagination algorithm in Python.
- Use the `hypermedia` concept for the API response.
- Write tests for a paginated API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- unittest module

## Tasks

### 0. Simple helper function
Implement a `get_page` function that takes two integer arguments `page` and `page_size`. The function should return a tuple of size two containing a start index and an end index corresponding to the range of indexes to return in a list for those particular pagination parameters.

### 1. Simple pagination
Implement a `index_range` function to return a tuple of size two containing a start index and an end index corresponding to the range of indexes to return in a list for those particular pagination parameters.

### 2. Hypermedia pagination
Implement a `get_hyper` function that takes two integer arguments `page` and `page_size`. The function should return a dictionary containing the following keys:
- `page_size`: the length of the returned dataset page
- `page`: the current page number
- `data`: the actual page of the dataset
- `next_page`: the number of the next page, `None` if no next page
- `prev_page`: the number of the previous page, `None` if no previous page
- `total_pages`: the total number of pages in the dataset

### 3. Deletion-resilient hypermedia pagination
Implement a `get_hyper_index` function that takes three arguments: `datasets`, `index`, `page_size`. The function should return a dictionary containing the following keys:
- `index`: the index of the current page. That is the index of the first item in the current page
- `next_index`: the index of the next page, `None` if no next page
- `prev_index`: the index of the previous page, `None` if no previous page
- `page_size`: the length of the returned dataset page
- `data`: an list of the items on the current page

## Usage

To use the pagination functionality, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-backend.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy
cd alx-backend/0x00-pagination
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the tests:
bash
Copy
python -m unittest discover tests
Implement the required functions in the api/v1/app.py file.
Tests
The project includes a set of tests to ensure the correct implementation of the pagination functionality. You can run the tests using the following command:

bash
Copy
python -m unittest discover tests
